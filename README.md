# Mental math practice!!

# My Plan

## During each round
* ask the user a random math question
* ask the user to sort the question into e,m,h
* use tkinter to make a better user interface

## After each round
* you are given option to practice the saved problems in the easy, medium, and hard problem sets
* you can press enter to try 10 more random problems
* you can also change it to just addition and subtraction mode

## Future updates
* use Tkinter to make a better user interface
* Save high score times and have a leader board
* make it into a phone app
* other mental math practice using percents, for example calulating a %10 tip or %60 off item.
